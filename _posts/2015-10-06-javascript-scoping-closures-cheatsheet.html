<p>
This is a brief reminder for myself 
about JavaScript's scoping rules, 
closures, and their interactions with 
control flow constructs like the <code>for</code>-loop.
</p>

<!-- cut -->

<p>
This post contains JavaScript code snippets that point out the peculiarities of
JavaScripts scoping mechanism.
Every code snippet comes together with a brief explanation of 
what's going on. 
If possible, I provide a translation between JavaScript constructs
and corresponding Scala constructs. Thus, this post might be of some
use to those who are familiar with Scala, but need a quick refresher in
JavaScript. Warning: the Scala-examples are not idiomatic, this is because
I wanted to make the analogies between Scala-code and JavaScript-code more
apparent.
</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
Scoping rules in JavaScript are quite different from the rules of C or Java. 
There is no block scope, 
control flow constructs (like the <code>for</code>-loop) do not introduce their 
own scope either, a variable can be re-declared multiple times within the same 
scope.
</p>

<p>
For most people used to C-style blocks, these scoping rules seem 
broken beyond repair. Since a change in semantics of the <code>var</code>
keyword would break just about every single web-application,
ECMAScript 6 introduced new keywords <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>
which should respect the block structure.
However, at the time of writing (October 2015), 
significant percentage of browsers do not support these
new language features, so I will look only at what is available right now, 
namely variables declared with the <code>var</code>-keyword.
</p>

<h2>Scoping</h2>
<p>
One can declare a variable with the same name in the same scope multiple times. 
The following code is valid:
{% highlight javascript %}
var x = 1;
console.log(x);
var x = 2;
console.log(x);
var x = "is now a string";
console.log(x);
{% endhighlight %}
It simply prints <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, 
and finally <code>"is now a string"</code>. No warnings are produced (
at least, my version of Firefox does not produce any).
</p>

<p>
There is no block-scope:
{% highlight javascript %}
var x = 42;
console.log(x);
console.log(y);
{
  var x = -1;
  var y = 314159;
  console.log(x);
  console.log(y);
}
console.log(x);
console.log(y);
{% endhighlight %}
When executed, the above code produces the following output:
{% highlight javascript %}
42 
undefined
-1
314159
-1
314159
{% endhighlight %}
Notice that the value of <code>x</code> remains <code>-1</code> after we 
leave the block. The variable <code>y</code> escapes the block, it's value
<code>314159</code> is available when we call <code>console.log(y)</code>
the last time. Also note that the second line does not produce a reference 
error: variable <code>y</code> is already in the scope, although it is has 
not been initialized yet.
</p>

<p>
It is similar for the <code>function</code> keyword: it also does not respect 
the block:
{% highlight javascript %}
function x() {
  console.log("1");
}
{
  function x() {
    console.log("2");
  }
  x();
}
x();
{% endhighlight %}
This code outputs <code>2</code> two times.
</p>

<p>
The <code>function</code> seems to be the only language construct that 
introduces it's own scope. For example, the following piece of code 
{% highlight javascript %}
var x = 42;
function foo() {
  var x = -1;
  var y = 314159;
  console.log(x);
  console.log(y);
}
foo();
console.log(x);
console.log(y);
{% endhighlight %}
produces the output <code>-1</code> 
  (it's the <code>x</code> from <code>foo</code>),
  <code>314159</code> (the <code>y</code> from <code>foo</code>),
  <code>42</code> (this is <code>x</code> from the outer scope),
  and then crashes with a Reference error, because it cannot find 
  any mention of <code>y</code>.

Therefore, we can use inline functions to simulate C-style blocks.
For example, this is how we could translate a block-construct from Scala 
to JavaScript;
<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-6">
{% highlight scala %}
// Scala
var x = 42
var z = 1000
{
  var x = -1
  var y = 314159
  z = 1000000
  println(x)
  println(y)
}
println(x)
println(z)
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<div class="col-xs-6">
{% highlight javascript %}
// JavaScript
var x = 42;
var z = 1000;
(function () {
  var x = -1;
  var y = 314159;
  z = 1000000;
  console.log(x);
  console.log(y);
})();
console.log(x);
console.log(z);
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
</div>
As expected, both programs output <code>-1,314159,42,1000000</code>, that is,
<code>z</code> is updated, and the old value of 
<code>x</code> is restored after we leave the
block.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, we can translate the following Scala construct without polluting
the namespace:
</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-6">
{% highlight scala %}
// Scala
var x = 42
var y = 10
var r = {
  var xSq = x * x
  var ySq = y * y
  math.sqrt(xSq + ySq)
}
println(r)
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<div class="col-xs-6">
{% highlight javascript %}
// JavaScript
var x = 42;
var y = 10;
var r = (function () {
  var xSq = x * x;
  var ySq = y * y;
  return Math.sqrt(xSq + ySq);
})();
console.log(r);
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
</div>

<p>
The interaction between variable and function declarations is also quite 
strange, the variables seem to shadow the functions, but no errors are 
produced (at least not until we try to call an integer as a function):
{% highlight javascript %}
var x = 42;
function x(y) {
  return y * y;
}

console.log(x);
console.log(x(x));
{% endhighlight %}
The above prints <code>42</code> and 
then crashes with the message "x is not a function".
Swapping the order of <code>var</code> and <code>function</code> 
does not change anything in this case.
</p>

<p>
The loop-variable in <code>for</code> also shares the same scope as all
the variables outside of the <code>for</code>-statement. For example:
{% highlight javascript %}
var i = 42;
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
console.log(i);
{% endhighlight %}
Produces <code>0,1,2,3</code>, instead of <code>0,1,2,42</code>.
As antidote, we could use the same hack as above, and wrap the 
<code>for</code>-loop into a nameless <code>function</code>.
</p>

<h2>Closures</h2>
<p>
Everything gets really weird as soon as JavaScripts scoping rules start to
interact with closures. Consider the following (very insidious) example:
{% highlight javascript %}
var fs = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  fs.push( function() {
    console.log("I am function " + i);
  });
}
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  fs[i]();
}
{% endhighlight %}
In the first loop, 
we fill an array with three functions that simply 
print their number when called. 
In the second loop, we go through the array, and call each function.
The output is 
{% highlight javascript %}
"I am function 0"
"I am function 1"
"I am function 2"
{% endhighlight %}
It seems to work just fine. But it just an illusion. Here is the same code,
but this time with <code>i</code> replaced by a fresh variable <code>j</code>
in the second loop:
{% highlight javascript %}
var fs = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  fs.push( function() {
    console.log("I am function " + i);
  });
}
for (var j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
  fs[j]();
}
{% endhighlight %}
This time, the output is <code>"I am function 3"</code> three times, which is
probably not what we intended when we wrote the first loop. The reason why this
happens is that the <code>i</code> in the closure refers to a mutable variable
that lives outside of the loop. Rewritten with while-loops, the first version of
the code snippet would look as follows:
{% highlight javascript %}
var fs = [];
var i = 0;
while (i < 3) {
  fs.push(function() {
    console.log("I am function " + i);
  });
  i++;
}
i = 0;
while (i < 3) {
  fs[i]();
  i++;
}
{% endhighlight %}
Thus, we store <emph>the same</emph> closure three times, but then call it
in three different contexts, with three different values of 
(still alive) variable <code>i</code>. This gives us seemingly correct results.
But as soon as we replace <code>i</code> by <code>j</code>, the mistake becomes
apparent, because the closure always returns <code>3</code>.
A systematic way to translate such closure-producing <code>for</code>-loops 
from Scala to JavaScript would be:
</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-6">
{% highlight scala %}
// Scala
var i = 42
var fs: List[() => Unit] = Nil

for (i <- 0 until 3) {

  fs :+= { () => 
    println("I am " + i) 
  }
}


for (i <- 0 until 3) {
  fs(i)()
}

println(i)

{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<div class="col-xs-6">
{% highlight javascript %}
// JavaScript
var i = 42;
var fs = [];
(function () {
  for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) { 
  (function(i) {
    fs.push(function() {
      console.log("I am " + i);
    });
  })(i);}
})();
(function () {
  for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    fs[i]();
  }
})();
console.log(i);
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
</div>
<p>
Now both pieces of code produce the same output, namely:
{% highlight javascript %}
"I am function 0"
"I am function 1"
"I am function 2"
42
{% endhighlight %}
Notice that one could get rid of the first and the last 
dummy-<code>function</code> by choosing different variable
names, and polluting the environment a little bit:
{% highlight javascript %}
var i = 42;
var fs = [];

for (var j = 0; j < 3; j++) { (function(i) {
  fs.push(function() {
    console.log("I am function " + i);
  });
})(j);}


for (var k = 0; k < 3; k++) {
  fs[k]();
}

console.log(i);
{% endhighlight %}
This code is clearly more readable. However, we cannot 
get rid of the dummy-<code>function</code> that encloses
the block of the first <code>for</code>-loop, because 
then we would close over the same mutable variable three 
times.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
JavaScript's scoping and closures behave very differently from
what I'm used to. 
I find it quite strange, but at least there is a simple 
and clear system of rules behind this behavior.
