  One of the requirements for this blog was that I should be able to
  publish interactive plots and visualizations online. 
  This post describes a little script that allows me to 
  create responsive two-dimensional level plots. 
  The implementation relies on binary plane partitioning in combination 
  with a priority queue, and evaluates the most interesting regions of 
  the plot first. Multiple patches of the function are evaluated in 
  parallel using web-workers coordinated by a simple 
  load balancer.

<p style="color: #AAAAAA;">
  Warning: This is not a step-by-step tutorial.
  The main function of the pieces of code below 
  is to remind myself that the whole thing,
  despite being entirely trivial, actually took some effort to get right.
</p>

<p>
  There is a myriad of plotting libraries for JavaScript, but there seems to
  be no good possibility to generate interactive two-dimensional level plots for
  functions that take a long time to evaluate. I used it as an excuse to 
  take a brief look at the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>, 
  JavaScript's typed arrays, and WebWorkers.
</p>

<p>
  The goal is as follows: I want to generate level plots in
  such a way that the more interesting regions are evaluated first, and
  presented to the user immediately, before the function is evaluated for
  each pixel of the canvas.
</p>

<p>
  My solution can be found in the <a href="#attachment">
  attached file <code>levelPlot.js</code></a>.
</p>

<p>
  The main ingredients are: 
  <ul>
    <li>A load-balancer for the WebWorkers</li>
    <li>A simple priority queue that allows us to evaluate the
      more interesting function patches first
    </li>
    <li>Binary space partitioning of the plotted region
      (we recursively divide the plotted region into smaller rectangles, 
      estimate how "interesting" the function is in each rectangle, and
      prioritize it accordingly)
    </li>
  </ul>
  Figure 1 shows how these components work together to generate a reasonable
  evaluation plan for a Julia set level plot for the function
  \(z \mapsto z^2 + c\). Notice that the plotting
  algorithm focuses on the details of the boundary of the Julia set first,
  delaying the costly evaluation in the regions around the attractors.
  This is exactly the behavior that we want to achieve: the algorithm shall
  draw the interesting pieces of the function as fast as possible, and 
  add the less interesting parts later.
</p>

        First 1000 patches of the binary space partition inserted into
        the priority queue. The smaller patches will be scheduled first.
        The coloring is random. The underlying function is the Julia-set
        iteration, the constant is controlled by mouse motions 
        (move the mouse to the center of left half of the square to get
        c = -1).

<h2>Load Balancer</h2>
<p>
The load balancer requires the path to the <code>.js</code> file that 
contains the code of the WebWorker. It generates the specified 
number of WebWorkers, and attaches the user defined 
<code>onJobDone</code> function as the <code>message</code>-listener to 
each WebWorker.
Internally, it maintains a queue with the jobs and a list of boolean flags 
that show whether a WebWorker is currently occupied or idle. Here is the
constructor and the member variables that represent the internal state of
the <code>LoadBalancer</code>:
</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
function LoadBalancer(
  workerSourceFile, 
  numWorkers, 
  onJobDone
) {
  var workers = new Array();
  var isOccupied = new Array();
  var todos = new Array();
  // [...]
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Here is how the WebWorkers are created:
</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
for (var i = 0; i < numWorkers; i++) { (function(i) {
  if (window.Worker) {
    var w = new Worker(workerSourceFile);
    w.addEventListener("message", function(msg) {
      onJobDone(msg.data);
      isOccupied[i] = false;
      tryAssignJob(i);
    });
    workers.push(w);
    isOccupied.push(false);
  } else {
     throw "Error: no web-worker support";
  }
})(i);}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
  The user-defined function <code>onJobDone</code> gets the data of 
  the message returned by the WebWorker. 
  In the above piece of code, we also 
  see that as soon as a WebWorker
  posts its answer, the <code>LoadBalancer</code> marks it as idle,
  and immediately tries to reassign a new job to it: this is what 
  ultimately balances the load across multiple workers.
</p>
<p>
  The awkward <code>(function(i){ ... })(i);</code> construct is necessary
  to close over the <code>i</code>-variable.
   <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/programming-languages/javascript-scoping-closures-cheatsheet.html">
     An earlier post
   </a> explains why the code would not work without it.
</p>
<p>
Assigning jobs is simple:
we dequeue a job from the  
<code>todos</code> queue, 
send it to the worker, and
mark the worker as occupied.
</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
function tryAssignJob(idx) {
  if (todos.length > 0 && !isOccupied[idx]) {
    var job = todos.shift();
    workers[idx].postMessage(job);
    isOccupied[idx] = true;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Priority queue</h2>
<p>
  We need some kind of priority queue in order to recompute and redraw the
  most interesting regions first.
  Since real priority queues are somewhat tricky to implement,
  I used an "approximate" priority queue instead. 
  The idea is to create a fixed number of bins, with a simple first-in-first-out
  queue in each bin. Here is an excerpt with the most relevant parts:
</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
function QuasiPriorityQueue(
  maxPriority,
  minPriority,
  numBins
) {
  this.bins = new Array(numBins);
  this.size = 0;

  var lookingAtBin = numBins - 1;     // highest nonempty bin
  var prioToBinFactor = (numBins - 1) / (maxPriority - minPriority);

  // initialization
  for (var b = 0; b < numBins; b++) {
    this.bins[b] = []; 
  }

  /** Enqueues an element with specified priority */
  this.enqueue = function(element, priority) {
    var approxBinIdx = 
      Math.floor((priority - minPriority) * prioToBinFactor);
    var binIdx = 
      Math.min(Math.max(approxBinIdx, 0), numBins - 1);
    var bin = this.bins[binIdx];
    bin.push(element);
    this.size++;

    // move the `lookingAt`-index up if necessary
    if (lookingAtBin < binIdx) {
      lookingAtBin = binIdx;
    }
  }

  /** Dequeues an element from the topmost non-empty bin */
  this.dequeue = function() {
    if (this.isEmpty()) {
      throw "Cannot dequeue element: queue is empty."
    } else {
      while (this.bins[lookingAtBin].length == 0) {
        lookingAtBin--;
      }
      var bin = this.bins[lookingAtBin];
      var res = bin.shift();
      this.size--;
      return res;
    }
  }

  [...]
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
  For this to work, the user has to choose the <code>maxPriority</code> and
  <code>minPriority</code> carefully, because otherwise there will be 
  too many jobs with too different priorities in the first and/or the last
  bin. If <code>minPriority</code> and <code>maxPriority</code> are chosen
  badly, this "quasi-priority queue" will degenerate into a first-in-first-out
  queue.
</p>

<h2>Binary plane partitioning</h2>

<p>
  Somewhat surprisingly (at least to me), pixel-aware binary plane 
  partitioning was quite difficult to get right. 
  It turned out to be very easy to make
  a <code>+-1</code> mistake, or distort the function by a factor 
  <code>n/(n-1)</code> somewhere. Here is what my current proposal for
  horizontal partitioning looks like:
</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
// split rectangle horizontally into [ A | B ]
var dx = worldRect.width / (screnRect.width - 1);

var aScrenWidth = Math.floor(screnRect.width / 2);
var bScrenWidth = screnRect.width - aScrenWidth;
var aScrenRight = screnRect.left + aScrenWidth;
var bScrenLeft = screnRect.right - bScrenWidth;

var aWorldWidth = (aScrenWidth - 1) * dx;
var bWorldWidth = (bScrenWidth - 1) * dx;
var aWorldRight = worldRect.left + aWorldWidth;
var bWorldLeft = worldRect.right - bWorldWidth;
 
var aTopRight = f(aWorldRight, worldRect.top);
var aBottomRight = f(aWorldRight, worldRect.bottom);

var bTopLeft = f(bWorldLeft, worldRect.top);
var bBottomLeft = f(bWorldLeft, worldRect.bottom);
    
var a = new FunctionPatch(
  new Rect(worldRect.left, aWorldRight, worldRect.bottom, worldRect.top),
  new Rect(screnRect.left, aScrenRight, screnRect.bottom, screnRect.top),
  [aTopRight, values[1], values[2], aBottomRight]
);
 
var b = new FunctionPatch(
  new Rect(bWorldLeft, worldRect.right, worldRect.bottom, worldRect.top),
  new Rect(bScrenLeft, screnRect.right, screnRect.bottom, screnRect.top),
  [values[0], bTopLeft, bBottomLeft, values[3]]
);
 
return [a, b];
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
  The vertical splitting is analogous.
</p>
<p>
  In order to draw the most interesting regions of the plot before the less
  interesting ones, we subdivide the plane recursively, and search for 
  small rectangular patches with large differences between the values on
  the corners. 
</p>
<p>
  We begin with a rectangle that
  covers the entire plotted region, 
  and put it into the quasi-priority queue.
</p>
<p>
  In each step, we dequeue a rectangular patch from the quasi-priority queue, 
  and check whether it can be further subdivided. 
  If it is small enough, we give it to the load balancer, and one of the 
  workers immediately begins to evaluate the function in this region.
</p>
<p>
  If the patch is too large, we split it into two smaller patches.
  Then we evaluate the function on the corners of each 
  new rectangular patch. Depending on how much the function varies on the
  corners of the patch, we assign a priority to the patch, and put it back
  into the priority queue.
</p>
<p>
  This process repeats until the (quasi-) priority queue becomes empty.
  Here is what the corresponding code looks like:
</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
this.redraw = function(id, param) {
  // clean load balancer's internal queue from obsolete jobs with 
  // same id
  loadBalancer.filterJobs(function(job) {
    return job.id !== id;
  });
  var f = funcFactory(param);
  ensureBufferExists(id);
  var bb = backBuffers[id];
  bb.param = param;
  var queue = new QuasiPriorityQueue(approxMinZ, approxMaxZ, 16);
  var entireArea = new FunctionPatch(
    new Rect(minX, maxX, minY, maxY),
    new Rect(
      0, backBuffers.visible.canvas.width, 
      0, backBuffers.visible.canvas.height
    ),
    [f(maxX, maxY), f(minX, maxY),
     f(minX, minY), f(maxX, minY)]
  )
  queue.enqueue(entireArea, 0);
  bb.numTodos = 0;
  while(!queue.isEmpty()) {
    var head = queue.dequeue();
    if (head.screnRect.area <= 2048) {
      loadBalancer.addJob(
        {
          id : id,
          param : param,
          screnRect : head.screnRect,
          worldRect : head.worldRect,
          paintingSettings: paintingSettings
        }
      );
      bb.numTodos++;
      // poke the load balancer so that it tries to 
      // assign the new job to idle workers 
      loadBalancer.assignJobs();
    } else {
      var ab = head.subdivide(f);
      var a = ab[0];
      var b = ab[1];
      var aValue = variationMeasure(a.values);
      var bValue = variationMeasure(b.values);
      queue.enqueue(a, aValue);
      queue.enqueue(b, bValue);
    }
  }
};
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
  This is the only place where the user-defined <code>variationMeasure</code>
  is used (this is one of the parameters passed to the constructor of the
  plot). For simple real-valued functions, the predefined function 
  <code>levelPlot.realCyclicVariation</code> is a reasonable way to 
  estimate how "interesting" the content of a patch is. In principle we could
  use any function that accepts a list with the four values on the corners and 
  returns some kind of variation-measure.
</p>

<p>
  The current version of the script has another feature worth mentioning:
  it can work with multiple named buffers. There is one special buffer that
  has the identifier <code>'visible'</code>: this is the buffer attached to
  the visible canvas. However, we can also call the above <code>redraw</code>
  function with an <code>id</code> not equal to <code>'visible'</code>. 
  This will trigger the creation of a new back-buffer, and the function will
  be evaluated and plotted to this new buffer. Later, we can use the methods
  <code>Plot.isReady(id)</code> and <code>Plot.show(id)</code> to check whether
  the image in the back buffer is complete, and to copy its content to the
  visible buffer.
</p>

  The next post describes how to use the <code>levelPlot.js</code> script.
