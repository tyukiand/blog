<p>
  This post describes the usage of <code>levelPlot.js</code>.
</p>

<!-- cut -->

<p>
  We will use the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">worn-out</span> 
  well-known function
  \[
     f_c(z) := z^2 + c \\
     F_c(z) := \min(
       N,\, \inf\{n\in\mathbb{N}_0 : \vert f_c^n(z) \vert > R \}
     )
  \]
  as an example. Here \(N\) is some maximum number of iterations, 
  and \(R\) is the bail-out radius.
  The reasons for this choice are: 
  <ul>
    <li>It's very easy to implement</li>
    <li>It produces very complicated shapes</li>
    <li>It's immediately obvious whether the plot is correct or not</li>
  </ul>
  therefore, it's an ideal test-case for a plotter. 
</p>
<p>
  We will create two plots.
  One plot will show the Julia-sets for the above quadratic polynomial, 
  the other plot will show the corresponding
  Mandelbrot set. The one with the Julia-sets will make use of 
  <code>levelPlot.js</code>, the
  plot with the Mandelbrot set will be static. It will be possible to
  click on the Mandelbrot set to fix a special value. A Julia-set for this
  special value will be rendered on a back-buffer. 
  After this, it will be possible to click on the Julia set to show some 
  orbits. On each click, the special back-buffer will be copied to the
  visible canvas. The orbit will be drawn on top of it.
</p>

<p>
  Here are the interactive plots:
</p>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-6">
      <canvas
        id = "mandelbrotCanvas"
        class="framed">
      </canvas>
  </div>
  <div class="col-xs-6">
      <canvas
        id = "juliaCanvas"
        class="framed">
      </canvas>
  </div>
</div>

<p> In the rest of this post, we will describe how it is implemented. </p>

<h2> WebWorker code </h2>
<p>
The <code>levelPlot.js</code> script makes use of the WebWorkers.
The easiest way to implement a <code>levelPlot.js</code>-compatible WebWorker 
is to copy the following piece of code, and modify the two parts that 
are enclosed by <code>BEGIN EDITING</code>, <code>END EDITING</code>

onmessage = function(msg) {

  // This is what is posted as message to the workers
  var data  = msg.data;
  var id = data.id;                // should be sent back in the answer
  var param = data.param;          // use for computation, sent it back 
  var screnRect = data.screnRect;  // pixel-dims. sent it back in the answer
  var worldRect = data.worldRect;  // which part are you computing
  // whatever you passed as painting settings to
  // the Plot constructor, it's passed to your workers
  var paintingSettings = data.paintingSettings;

  // this is a basic setup of the result array
  var sw = screnRect.width;
  var sh = screnRect.height;
  var pixels = new Uint8ClampedArray(sw * sh * 4);

  // here are a few helper variables that are 
  // useful for generating (x,y)-values for each pixel
  var dx = worldRect.width / (sw - 1);

<p>
  In the first block (marked with <code>[1/2]</code>), 
  one has the opportunity to perform some computations 
  that are common for the entire function patch. In particular, one might 
  want to extract some values from the <code>param</code>, and from the
  <code>paintingSettings</code>-objects. 
  The <code>param</code> is what is sent to
  the workers when the <code>Plot.redraw(id, param)</code> method is 
  invoked. In the case of Julia-set level plot, this will be the complex 
  constant <code>c</code> with components <code>re</code> and <code>im</code>.
  The <code>paintingSettings</code> is a copy of the object that has been 
  passed to the constructor <code>levelPlot.Plot</code>, in this case it 
  contains the (fixed) number of iterations, the bail-out radius, and a
  palette that is used to compute the colors of each pixel.
</p>

<p>
  In the block <code>[2/2]</code>, we have to take the current values 
  <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, and transform them into three colors
  <code>red</code>, <code>green</code> and <code>blue</code>.
</p>

<h2>Constructor <code>levelPlot.Plot</code></h2>
<p> 
  Here is what the <code>levelPlot.Plot</code>-constructor call looks like 
  in this example:
</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
juliaSetResponsivePlot = new levelPlot.Plot(
  function(c) {
    return function(zRe, zIm) {
      return quadraticFractalIteration(
        zRe, zIm, c.re, c.im, maxIters, bailOutSq
      );
    };
  },
  SCRIPTS_PATH + "juliaSetWebWorker.js",
  -2, 2, -2, 2,
  levelPlot.realCyclicVariation,
  0, maxIters * 4,
  "juliaCanvas",
  {
    palette : palette,
    maxIters : maxIters,
    bailOut : bailOut
  }
);
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
  The first argument of the constructor is a function family, that is,
  a function that takes a parameter, and returns another function that in 
  turn takes two real values. In this case, our function family \( \{F_c\}_c \)
  is parameterized by the summand \(c\). For each fixed \(c\), the function 
  \(F_c\) takes a complex number \(z = z_{re} + i\cdot z_{im}\), and returns
  a natural number.
</p>
<p>
  The second argument is the path to the web-worker script.
  The <code>SCRIPT_PATH</code> that you see above is a hack to make it work
  with Jekyll-generated blogs, if you want to use <code>levelPlot.js</code>
  in some other environment, you can set the path explicitly.
</p>
<p>
  The next four parameters specify a plotted region: 
  <code>min_x</code>, <code>max_x</code>, <code>min_y</code>, 
  <code>max_y</code>. 
</p>
<p>
  The next three parameters determine how we prioritize the function patches.
  The variation measure is a function that takes a list with four values, and
  returns a priority. The two numbers are the minimum priority and the 
  maximum possible priority.
  These numbers depend on the choice of the
  variation measure. 
  In this example, the priority
  is computed as follows: if <code>[v0, v1, v2, v3]</code> are the 
  four function values on the corners of a rectangular patch 
  (in the order: top-right, top-left, bottom-left, bottom-right), then the
  priority is computed as 
  \[
    realCyclicVariation([v_0, \dots, v_3]) := 
      \sum_{i=0}^3
        \left\vert v_i - v_{(i + 1) \, \textrm{mod} \, 4}\right\vert. 
  \]
  In this particular example, the function \(F_c\) takes values between 0
  and <code>maxIters</code>, therefore, the minimum priority that we can 
  assign to a patch is 0, and the maximum priority is <code>4 * maxIters</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, we specify the <code>id</code> of the canvas and some additional
  settings that are common for all plots 
  (number of iterations, a color palette).
</p>

<h2>Repainting, using named back-buffers</h2>
<p>
  Now, whenever we move the mouse, a new Julia set is 
  rendered on the visible canvas:
</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
  juliaResponsivePlot.redraw('visible', {re: re, im: im});
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Whenever we click on the Mandelbrot set, a Julia set for the special 
  chosen value is rendered into a back-buffer (called <code>'chosen'</code>):
</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
  juliaResponsivePlot.redraw('chosen', {re: chosen_cRe, im: chosen_cIm});
{% endhighlight %}

<p> 
  If we click on the Julia canvas, the content of the <code>'chosen'</code> 
  buffer is copied to the <code>'visible'</code> canvas:
</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
  juliaResponsivePlot.show('chosen');
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
The responsive level plot works as expected, and the code is even kind-of
reusable. 
However, the advantage of this (relatively complex) evaluation strategy 
is not immediately obvious if one compares it to the straightforward 
single-threaded line-by-line evaluation: it doesn't look much faster.
For functions that can be easily evaluated using a GPU, this evaluation 
strategy makes even less sense.
Maybe I should try it out with a larger canvas and weirder functions, 
where the advantage becomes more obvious.
